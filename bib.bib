 abstract = {The paper considers a number of problems arising from the test of serial correlation based on the d statistic proposed earlier by the authors (Durbin & Watson, 1950, 1951). Methods of computing the exact distribution of d are investigated and the exact distribution is compared with six approximations to it for four sets of published data. It is found that approximations suggested by Theil and Nagar and by Hannan are too inaccurate for practical use but that the beta approximation proposed in the 1950 and 1951 papers and a new approximation, called by us the a + bdU approximation and based, like the beta approximation, on the exact first two moments of d, both perform well. The power of the d test is compared with that of certain exact tests proposed by Theil, Durbin, Koerts and Abrahamse from the standpoint of invariance theory. It is shown that the d test is locally most powerful invariant but that the other tests are not. There are three appendices. The first gives an account of the exact distribution of d. The second derives the mean and variance to a second order of approximation of a modified maximum likelihood statistic closely related to d. The third sets out details of the computations required for the a + bdU approximation.},

abstract = {Abstract R, an open-source programming environment for data analysis and graphics, has in only a decade grown to become a de-facto standard for statistical analysis against which many popular commercial programs may be measured. The use of R for the teaching of econometric methods is appealing. It provides cutting-edge statistical methods which are, by R's open-source nature, available immediately. The software is stable, available at no cost, and exists for a number of platforms, including various flavours of Unix and Linux, Windows (9x/NT/2000), and the MacOS. Manuals are also available for download at no cost, and there is extensive on-line information for the novice user. This review focuses on using R for teaching econometrics. Since R is an extremely powerful environment, this review should also be of interest to researchers. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
